# Zoe AI — Project Context

Rails 8.0 AI companion app using RubyLLM, PostgreSQL (with vector support), and SolidQueue. The core concept is a conversational AI ("Zoe") that builds up persistent knowledge about people through structured fact extraction.

**Why:** Personalized AI companion that remembers who you are across conversations, not just within a session.

**How to apply:** Frame all architectural suggestions in terms of Rails conventions, ActiveRecord, and background jobs.

## Key Directories
- `app/models/` — Fact, Character, Topic, Message, Chat, Instruction, User
- `lib/ai/actors/` — ExtractFacts, DescribeCharacter, SummarizeLines, ObjectifyChat
- `lib/ai/` — BaseAgent subclasses (e.g. `ExtractionFactsAgent`)
- `lib/ai/tools/` — Memory (topic_search + last_chat_search via embeddings)
- `app/prompts/` — ERB templates for all LLM system prompts
- `app/jobs/` — ExtractFactsJob, CloseChatsJob, SummarizeChatJob, etc.

## Domain Model

**User** — authentication/profile (email, first_name, last_name). `has_and_belongs_to_many :characters`. Has `main_character` (preferred character).

**Character** — the conversational entity (name, ai flag, description, instructions). Participates in chats. Third-party characters (people, pets) are created automatically during fact extraction when first mentioned.

**Chat** — two-way conversation; `belongs_to :character` (user) and `belongs_to :partner` (AI). Has `closed` flag (set at midnight), `summary` (generated async after closure).

**Fact** — structured knowledge extracted from conversations:
- `character_id` (subject), `author_id` (who mentioned it), `content` (3rd person text)
- `persistent` (bool) — persistent = identity traits; non-persistent = time-bound events
- `kind` — attribute | experience | belief | preference | plan
- `importance` (0-100) — facts <20 discarded at extraction
- `time` — past | present | future; `date_from`, `date_to` for event ranges
- `topic_id` — FK to topics (flat, name-only, created dynamically)
- `chat_id`, `message_id` — source tracking

**Message** — `has_many_attached :attachments` (ActiveStorage). `content_raw` stores raw provider response for assistant message replay. Visibility includes attachment-only messages (no text).

## RubyLLM Chat Session Persistence Pattern

Two ways to use an agent with a Chat:
- **`.new(chat:).chat`** — persists messages to the DB (visible in UI)
- **`.chat(chat:)`** (class method) — in-memory session, no persistence (for extraction, summarization, internal reasoning)

## Extraction Pipeline

1. `ExtractFactsJob` triggers after each message (background, concurrency-limited per chat)
2. `AI::Actors::ExtractFacts` orchestrates: instantiates `ExtractionFactsAgent`, processes messages sequentially
3. Returns schema-enforced `{ "facts": [...] }` JSON; `build_fact()` creates records
4. Multi-subject statements → separate facts per character (no HABTM on facts)

**Memory mode toggle** (`memorize` boolean on Message): When `false`, message is added to LLM context with empty facts response (`[]`) for continuity, but extraction is skipped. AI messages auto-inherit from the last user message. User can toggle via brain icon in chat input; state is stored as a **module-scoped JS variable** in `ChatInputController` — persists across Turbo navigations (state stays off while chatting), but resets to `true` on page refresh/reopen. No cookie persistence; lives only in browser memory for the session.

## Character Description Generation

- Triggered when a persistent fact is saved (`character.description_up_to_date = false`)
- Groups persistent facts into 4 time buckets (>12mo, 12-6mo, 6-3mo, <3mo), sub-grouped by topic
- **One LLM call per time period** (not per topic) — O(periods) calls instead of O(periods × topics)
- LLM produces `<topic name="...">` XML sections; code wraps in `<period from="..." to="...">` tags
- Stored as nested XML, injected into system prompt for all subsequent chats

## System Prompt Structure

Uses XML tags for hard semantic boundaries between sections:
- `<context>` — date, conversation partner, last conversation time
- `<identity role="assistant">` / `<identity role="user">` — character descriptions (prevents identity bleed)
- `<known_people>` → `<person name="...">` — other known characters
- `<events>` — non-persistent facts grouped by temporal period
- `<yesterday_conversation>` — yesterday's chat summaries (injected directly, not via tool)
- `<instructions>` — AI-specific instructions

**System prompt caching:** `BaseAgent#apply_instructions` snapshots the rendered prompt into the `messages` table as a system message on the **first agent invocation** for a chat (via `RespondJob` → `find` with `persist: false`), using RubyLLM's `with_instructions` + `persist_system_instruction`. On subsequent requests, `apply_instructions` returns early if a persistent system message exists (checks `chat.messages_association.where(role: :system).exists?`), avoiding re-render. This means `to_llm` loads the frozen system message from DB, LLM sees identical bytes every turn → consistent cache hits. No explicit `sync_instructions!` call needed; the snapshot happens transparently. Semantic model: mid-conversation extractions (ExtractFactsJob, DescribeCharacterJob) affect the *next* chat's prompt only.

## Key Design Decisions

**Markdown rendering in messages** — Server-side via `redcarpet` gem in `ApplicationHelper#markdown`. Instantiates new renderer on each call (thread-safe). Supports fenced code, tables, strikethrough, autolink, hard line breaks. Links open in new tab (`rel=noopener`). Applied in `message_component.html.erb` for all message content.

**Yesterday's summaries in system prompt** (not via tool): Tools are opt-in; LLM won't reliably call recall. Direct injection ensures automatic conversational continuity. Older conversations use the Memory tool.

**LLM context pollution prevention**: System-injected annotations (e.g. attachment blob IDs) are added at LLM read time (`extract_content`) but stripped before DB persistence (`prepare_content_for_storage`). Prevents LLM from learning to reproduce system annotations.

**Daily chat closure**: `CloseChatsJob` runs at midnight, sets `closed: true`, broadcasts redirect immediately. Summarization runs async via `SummarizeChatJob` to keep the critical path short. Startup initializer catches stale chats from restarts.

**Image generation**: `AI.paint` wraps RubyLLM with `with:` parameter for image-to-image (OpenRouter provider only). Characters have `has_many_attached :images` with `metadata[:description]` for selection.

**Message bubble styling**: `.chat-bubble` uses `--tw-prose-*` CSS custom properties set to `currentColor`, making all prose typography (text, headings, links, code) inherit the bubble's text color directly. This eliminates the need for separate `prose-invert` classes and ensures text color matches backgrounds automatically. Markdown is rendered server-side and styled with `prose prose-sm max-w-none` classes. The Tailwind typography plugin is loaded via `@plugin "@tailwindcss/typography"` in PostCSS.

**Actor error handling**: Use `fail_on RubyLLM::Error` in actors for graceful degradation in jobs — returns failed Result instead of raising.

## Running Commands

Always use `bash -lc "rvm 3.4.4@ai do <command>"` — e.g. `bash -lc "rvm 3.4.4@ai do bin/rails db:migrate"`.

## Internationalization (i18n)

Rails i18n with `config/locales/en.yml` and `ru.yml`. Always add keys to **both** files.

Key conventions: `label_*` (buttons/forms), `placeholder_*` (inputs), `confirm_*` (dialogs), `text_*` (static text/HTML).
