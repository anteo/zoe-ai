# Zoe AI — Project Context

Rails 8.0 AI companion app using RubyLLM, PostgreSQL (with vector support), and SolidQueue. The core concept is a conversational AI ("Zoe") that builds up persistent knowledge about people through structured fact extraction.

**Why:** Personalized AI companion that remembers who you are across conversations, not just within a session.

**How to apply:** Frame all architectural suggestions in terms of Rails conventions, ActiveRecord, and background jobs.

## Key directories
- `app/models/` — Fact, Character, Topic, Message, Chat, Instruction
  - `Chat` associations: `belongs_to :user` (Character) and `belongs_to :partner` (Character)
- `lib/ai/actors/` — ExtractFacts, DescribeCharacter, SummarizeLines, ObjectifyChat
- `lib/ai/` — BaseAgent subclasses: `ExtractionFactsAgent` (facts extraction LLM wrapper)
- `lib/ai/tools/` — Memory (topic_search + last_chat_search via embeddings)
- `app/prompts/` — ERB templates for all LLM system prompts
- `app/jobs/` — ExtractFactsJob (background, concurrency-limited per chat)

## Facts Table Schema
- `character_id` — who the fact is about
- `author_id` — who mentioned it
- `content` — fact text (3rd person)
- `persistent` (bool, default true) — persistent = identity-defining; non-persistent = time-bound events
- `kind` — "attribute" | "experience" | "belief" | "preference" | "plan"
- `importance` (0-100, default 50) — facts <20 are discarded at extraction time
- `time` — "past" | "present" | "future"
- `date_from`, `date_to` — event date range
- `mentioned_at` — when fact was mentioned in conversation
- `topic_id` — FK to topics table (flat, name-only categorization)
- `chat_id`, `message_id` — source tracking

## Extraction Pipeline
1. `ExtractFactsJob` (background, concurrency-limited per chat) triggers after each message
2. `AI::Actors::ExtractFacts` (`lib/ai/actors/extract_facts.rb`) — orchestrates the loop
3. Actor instantiates `AI::ExtractionFactsAgent.new(chat:)` and calls `.chat` on it to get the configured RubyLLM session (`llm_chat`)
4. Processes messages sequentially; already-extracted messages become context via `add_message`
5. Returns `{ "facts": [...] }` JSON (schema-enforced); `build_fact()` creates ActiveRecord records
6. Prompt: `app/prompts/ai/extraction_facts_agent/instructions.txt.erb`

## ExtractionFactsAgent (`lib/ai/extraction_facts_agent.rb`)
- Inherits from `AI::BaseAgent`
- `inputs :chat` — the Rails `Chat` record being processed
- `temperature 0.1`
- `instructions topics: -> { Topic.all }` — renders prompt with topics
- Schema defined inline via `ruby_llm-schema` DSL: wraps result in `{ facts: [...] }`; each fact has typed fields with enums/ranges
- **`initialize(chat:, **kwargs)`** is required: `chat:` conflicts with `RubyLLM::Agent`'s own `chat:` kwarg (pre-built session), so must route via `super(inputs: { chat: }, **kwargs)`
- Actor uses `AI::ExtractionFactsAgent.new(chat:).chat` — gets the configured RubyLLM chat session and drives it directly

## Persistent vs Non-Persistent Facts
- **Persistent**: long-term identity traits → feed into character description generation
- **Non-persistent**: specific events → shown in system prompt grouped by temporal period
- Saving a persistent fact sets `character.description_up_to_date = false` → triggers `DescribeCharacter`

## Character Description Generation
- `AI::Actors::DescribeCharacter` (`lib/ai/actors/describe_character.rb`)
- Groups persistent facts into 4 time buckets (>12mo, 12-6mo, 6-3mo, <3mo)
- Summarizes each bucket with LLM (temp 0.1) using `app/prompts/describe_person.erb`
- Joins summaries with time-period headers → stored in `character.description`

## System Prompt Structure (`app/prompts/ai/zoe/instructions.txt.erb`)
1. Partner (AI) character description
2. User character description
3. Other known characters
4. Non-persistent facts grouped by temporal period (`time_facts.txt.erb`)
5. AI-specific instructions from `instructions` table
6. Current date/time + last conversation timestamp

## Memory Tool (`lib/ai/tools/memory.rb`)
- `topic_search(query, name, detailed)` — semantic search via embeddings
- `last_chat_search(name, detailed)` — retrieve last conversation with a person
- Both use PostgreSQL vector extension

## Topics
- Flat table, name only, created dynamically during extraction
- One topic per fact (optional)

## Message Model (`app/models/message.rb`)
- `has_many_attached :attachments` — ActiveStorage attachments on messages
- `content_raw` (JSON) — stores raw provider response for assistant messages; used by `RubyLLM::Content::Raw` to bypass provider formatting on replay
- `extract_content` is overridden to route by role **before** checking `content_raw`; RubyLLM's `acts_as_message` super checks `content_raw` first regardless of role, which is wrong for user messages
- For user messages, `super` downloads ActiveStorage attachments to tempfiles and returns a `RubyLLM::Content` object
- `RubyLLM::Content.new(text, attachments_array)` accepts an array of existing `RubyLLM::Attachment` objects as its second argument (no re-download needed)

## LLM Context Pollution & Content Sanitization Pattern

**Anti-pattern**: System-injected annotations should never appear in message text that the LLM sees as its own prior output, because the LLM learns to reproduce the format.

**Solution**: Use a two-stage approach:
1. **At LLM read time** (`extract_content`): Inject system annotations so the LLM has the context it needs
2. **At DB write time** (`prepare_content_for_storage`): Strip system annotations before persistence

This ensures annotations are always available to the LLM but never accumulate in the database.

**Applied here**: `Message#extract_content` appends `(files attached: [...])` suffix with blob IDs so the LLM can reference attachments in tool calls. `Chat#prepare_content_for_storage` strips this suffix before saving so the LLM never sees it as part of its own prior output.

## Chat Model ActiveStorage Integration (`app/models/chat.rb`)
- `messages_association` preloads `:attachments_blobs` so RubyLLM can access blobs without N+1 queries
- `persist_content` merges `attachments_to_persist` (deferred attachments) before delegating to super
- `prepare_content_for_storage` forces attachments to a non-nil array so `persist_content` is always called
- `prepare_for_active_storage` splits ActiveStorage hashes (already-persisted blobs) from other attachments before super

## MessagesController (`app/controllers/messages_controller.rb`)
- Accepts attachments via `params.require(:message).permit(:content, attachments: [])`
- Creates `RubyLLM::Content.new(content, attachments)` before `chat.add_message` — attachments are raw uploaded files at this point, saved by RubyLLM's ActiveRecord hooks

## Third-Party Characters & Multi-Subject Facts
- Third-party characters (people, pets, etc.) are created automatically during extraction when first mentioned
- When a statement involves multiple subjects (e.g. "my cat Сима likes playing balls"), extract **separate facts per character** — one for the user ("has a cat named Сима") and one for Сима ("likes playing small soft balls")
- Do NOT use HABTM to link one fact to multiple characters — facts should describe only their actual subject; sharing a fact across characters produces semantically wrong descriptions

## Message Actions (Edit, Delete, Resend)

- Routes: `resources :messages, only: [:create, :update, :destroy]` with member `post :resend`
- `update`: Replace message content → destroy all later messages → re-render chat from DB
- `destroy`: Remove message → Turbo remove from DOM
- `resend`: Destroy all later messages → re-render chat from DB (re-runs AI response)
- Authorization: Check `message.user?` for edit/resend; delete available for all
- Finding message: `Message.joins(:chat).where(id:, chats: { user: @current_user }).first` ensures permission
- When editing/resending: re-render the **entire chat container** from DB state (not individual stream elements), then `RespondJob` broadcasts the new AI response via Action Cable

## Internationalization (i18n)

Rails i18n with `config/locales/en.yml` and `ru.yml`. Always add keys to **both** files.

Translation key conventions:
- **`label_*`** — UI button/form labels
- **`placeholder_*`** — Input placeholder text
- **`confirm_*`** — Confirmation/dialog messages
- **`text_*`** — Static text blocks, often HTML

## Running commands

Always use `bash -lc "rvm 3.4.4@ai do <command>"` — e.g. `bash -lc "rvm 3.4.4@ai do bin/rails db:migrate"`.

## Job Cancellation with SolidQueue

The `MissionControl` concern provides a pattern for canceling jobs across all execution states:

**Key states in SolidQueue:**
- `SolidQueue::ClaimedExecution` — currently running
- `SolidQueue::ScheduledExecution` — scheduled for future run
- `SolidQueue::ReadyExecution` — ready but not yet claimed
- `SolidQueue::BlockedExecution` — blocked (e.g., due to concurrency limits)

**Cancellation pattern** (`MissionControl#cancel`):
1. For **running** jobs: set `execution.cancelled = true` (stops mid-execution via early return check)
2. For **scheduled/ready/blocked** jobs: call `execution.job.discard` (removes from queue entirely)

**In job perform method**: Always check `execution&.cancelled?` early:
```ruby
def perform(...)
  return if execution&.cancelled?
  # ... rest of job logic
end
```

## Dynamic Tool Parameters in RubyLLM

The `params do ... end` block is evaluated as a proc each time the schema is serialized, so DB queries inside it always reflect current state — no `params_schema` override needed:

```ruby
params do
  characters = ::Character.all.map { |c| "#{c.id} (#{c.name})" }.join(", ")

  string :character_id,
         description: "ID of the character. Available: #{characters}",
         enum: ::Character.pluck(:id).map(&:to_s),
         required: true
end
```

Use `enum` + `description` together: enum enforces constraints, description gives the LLM human-readable context.

## Image Generation (`AI.paint`)

`AI.paint` wraps RubyLLM's image generation with an added `with:` parameter for image-to-image:

- **Text-to-image** (`with:` omitted): delegates directly to `RubyLLM::Image.paint`
- **Image-to-image** (`with: [blob, ...]`): only supported via the custom `AI::Providers::OpenRouter` subclass (`lib/ai/providers/open_router.rb`), which overrides `paint` to pass source images as content in the request payload

When `with:` is present and the resolved provider is not `AI::Providers::OpenRouter`, it raises an error. Other providers can be patched by subclassing their RubyLLM provider and overriding `paint` similarly.

## Daily Chat Closure Pattern

Chats created on previous days are considered "closed" and should redirect users to prevent further messaging. This is implemented at two levels:

**Level 1 (Controller)**: In `find_chat` or similar controller action, check `@chat.from_previous_day?` and redirect to `root_path` if true. This handles direct navigation to old chat URLs.

**Level 2 (Browser)**: Use a Stimulus controller to monitor date changes:
- Store the chat's creation date in a `data` attribute on the container
- Check periodically (e.g., every minute) and on `visibilitychange` event
- If `Date.current` differs from chat creation date, call `window.location.reload()` (controller redirect handles the rest)
- This catches cases where a user has an old chat tab open at midnight

**Helper**: `Chat#from_previous_day?` returns `created_at.to_date < Date.current` — use this in both controller and JS.
